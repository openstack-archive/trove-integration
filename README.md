## Integration dev scripts, tests and docs for Trove.

***

### Steps to setup this environment:

Install a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) image ( _We suggest to create a virtual machine_ )

#### Login to the machine as root

#### Make sure we have git installed:

    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install git-core -y

#### Add a user named ubuntu if you do not already have one:

    # adduser ubuntu
    # visudo

  add this line to the file below the root user

    ubuntu  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

    **OR use this if you dont want to type your password to sudo a command**

    ubuntu  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

  if /dev/pts/0 does not have read/write for your user

    # chmod 666 /dev/pts/0

  *Note that this number can change and if you can not connect to the screen session then the /dev/pts/# needs modding like above.*

#### Login with ubuntu:

    # su ubuntu
    $ cd ~

#### Clone this repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/trove-integration.git

#### Go into the scripts directory:

    $ cd trove-integration/scripts/

#### Running redstack is the core script:
*Run this to get the command list with a short description of each*

    $ ./redstack

#### Install all the dependencies and then install trove via redstack.
*This brings up trove (rd-api rd-tmgr) and initializes the trove database.*

    $ ./redstack install

***

#### Connecting to the screen session

    $ screen -x stack

*If that command fails with the error*

    Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1'

*If that command fails with the error chmod the corresponding /dev/pts/#*

    $ chmod 660 /dev/pts/1

#### Detach from the screen session
Allows the services to continue running in the background

    ctrl+a then d

***

#### Kick start the build/test-init/build-image commands
*Add mysql as a parameter to set build and add the mysql guest image*

    $ ./redstack kick-start mysql

*Optional commands if you did not run kick-start*

#### Initialize the test configuration and set up test users

    $ ./redstack test-init

#### Build the image and add it to glance

    $ ./redstack build-image mysql

***

#### You may need to add this iptables rule, be sure to save it!

    $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

***

### Reset your environment

#### Stop all the services running in the screens and refresh the environment:

    $ killall -9 screen
    $ screen -wipe
    $ RECLONE=yes ./redstack install
    $ ./redstack kick-start mysql

 or

    $ RECLONE=yes ./redstack install
    $ ./redstack build
    $ ./redstack test-init
    $ ./redstack build-image mysql

***

### Recover after reboot
If the VM was restarted, then the process for bringing up Openstack and Trove is quite simple

    $./redstack start-deps
    $./redstack start

Use screen to ensure all modules have started without error

    $screen -r stack

### VMware Fusion 5 speed improvement
We found out that if you are running ubuntu with KVM or Qemu it can be extremely slow. We found some ways of making this better with in VMware settings.
On a clean install of ubuntu 12.04 enable these options in VMware. (likey the same in other virutalizing platforms)

1. Shutdown the Ubuntu VM.

2. Go to the VM Settings -> Processors & Memory -> Advanced Options
   Check the "Enable hypervisor applications in this virtual machine"
   There is one other option that may improve your performance overall as well.

3. Go to the VM Settings -> Advanced
   Set the "Troubleshooting" option to "None"

4. I would suggest after setting these create a snapshot so that in cases where things break down you can revert to a clean snapshot.

5. Boot up the VM and run the `./redstack install`

6. To verify that KVM is setup properly after the devstack installation you can run these commands.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```
