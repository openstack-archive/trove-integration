Sets up HBase in a guest image.

These elements setup a HBase system in standalone mode. They provide
ubuntu-hbase-standalone which is required by
ubuntu-hbase-pseudo-distributed.

ubuntu-hbase-pseudo-distributed has elements which will make some
changes to the settings done here to make pseudo-distributed work.
